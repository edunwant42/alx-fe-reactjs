By completing this project, you will learn to:

- ✅ Install and configure Tailwind CSS in a React project
- ✅ Style React components using Tailwind CSS utility classes
- ✅ Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Add interactivity and transitions using Tailwind CSS

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/edunwant42/alx-fe-reactjs.git
cd alx-fe-reactjs/tailwind-react-integration
```

2. Install dependencies:

```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## 🛠️ Project Setup

This project was created using Vite and configured with Tailwind CSS following these steps:

### 1. React Project Creation
```bash
npm create vite@latest tailwind-react-integration -- --template react
cd tailwind-react-integration
```

### 2. Tailwind CSS Installation
```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

### 3. Vite Configuration
Updated `vite.config.js` to include the Tailwind CSS plugin:

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
})
```

### 4. CSS Configuration
Added Tailwind directives to `src/index.css`:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
