# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

 # Advanced Routing Demo

This folder demonstrates advanced routing patterns with `react-router-dom`: nested routes, dynamic routes, and protected routes (simulated authentication).

What to look at
- `src/App.jsx`: router setup and route definitions.
- `src/context/AuthContext.jsx`: very small auth simulation used by the protected route.
- `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`: redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`.
- `src/components/Profile.jsx`, `ProfileDetails.jsx`, `ProfileSettings.jsx`: example of a nested route.
- `src/components/PostsList.jsx`, `Post.jsx`: dynamic route using `:postId`.

Run locally
1. Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
cd react-router-advanced
npm install react-router-dom
npm run dev
```

2. Open the printed URL (usually `http://localhost:5173/`).

Routes and usage
- `/`: Home page.
- `/posts`: Posts list; click any post to open `/posts/:postId` (dynamic route).
- `/profile`: Protected route; if not logged in you will be redirected to `/login`. After login you return to `/profile` and can open nested children (`/profile/settings`).

Notes
- Auth is simulated in `AuthContext` using component state and is not persisted.
- `ProtectedRoute` uses `<Navigate to="/login" state={{ from: location }} />` so users return to the page they requested after login.
