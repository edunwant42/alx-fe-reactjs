# Form Handling in React

This small demo project demonstrates two approaches to form handling in React:

- Controlled components using React's `useState` (a simple `RegistrationForm`).
- Formik with Yup schema validation (`formikForm.jsx`) for declarative form state and validation.

It's part of the ALX frontend React exercises covering routers, data handling, forms and testing.

## What you'll find

- `src/components/RegistrationForm.jsx` — a controlled-component registration form with basic validation.
- `src/components/formikForm.jsx` — the same form implemented with Formik + Yup.
- `src/App.jsx` — renders both forms for comparison.

## Setup

From the project folder (`form-handling-react`):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser.

## Notes

- The forms simulate API submission locally and display a small "Submitted (simulated)" box on success.
- Dependencies used: `react`, `react-dom`, `formik`, `yup`, and Vite for development.

## Next steps (suggested)

- Wire the forms to a real (or mocked) API endpoint using `fetch` or `axios`.
- Add unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library to validate form behavior and validation.
- Add routing and protected routes as part of the larger assignment.

If you want, I can add tests or rename `formikForm.jsx` to `formikForm.js` to match assignment wording — tell me which.
