# Form Handling in React

Simple demo for the assignment: Routers, Data handling, Forms and Testing in React.

This directory focuses on Task 0 from the assignment: implementing form handling using
controlled components and Formik + Yup.

What you'll find

- `src/components/RegistrationForm.jsx` — a controlled-components registration form
- `src/components/formikForm.jsx` — the same form implemented with Formik + Yup
- `src/App.jsx` — wired to show both forms

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the app at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) and try both forms.

Controlled vs Formik (short)

- Controlled components: you use `useState` and handle input updates and validation manually. Good for small forms and when you want full control.
- Formik + Yup: Formik manages form state and submit flow; Yup provides declarative validation. Better for larger or more complex forms.

Notes

- Submissions are simulated locally (no real API call).
- If you want the Formik file renamed to `formikForm.js`, tell me and I'll rename it.

That's it — short and focused. If you'd like, I can add a mock API submit, tests, or tidy the UI.
