# Form Handling in React

## Assignment: main concepts (short)

This workspace demonstrates the key concepts required by the assignment in small focused demos.

Main concepts

- Routing: nested, dynamic and protected routes (React Router).
- Data handling: fetching, caching and updating data (React Query).
- Forms: controlled components and Formik + Yup for validation.
- Testing: unit and integration tests for components (Jest + React Testing Library).

Quick run (example)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the dev URL shown in your terminal (e.g. http://localhost:5173/) and explore the demo folders.

Folders of interest

- `form-handling-react/` — form demos (controlled + Formik)
- `react-query-demo/` — React Query demo
- `react-router-advanced/` — routing demos
- `react-todo/` — Todo component + tests

If you want a more detailed README per demo or a short checklist mapping tasks to files, I can add that.
