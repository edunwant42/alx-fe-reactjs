# Form Handling in React

Simple demo for the assignment: Routers, Data handling, Forms and Testing in React.

This directory focuses on Task 0 from the assignment: implementing form handling using
controlled components and Formik + Yup.

What you'll find
- `src/components/RegistrationForm.jsx` - a controlled-components registration form
- `src/components/formikForm.jsx` - the same form implemented with Formik + Yup
- `src/App.jsx` - wired to show both forms

Quick start
1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173/ and try both forms.

Notes
- Submissions are simulated locally (no real API call).
- If you want the Formik file renamed to `formikForm.js`, tell me and I'll rename it.

That's it â€” short and focused. If you'd like, I can add a mock API submit, tests, or tidy the UI.
